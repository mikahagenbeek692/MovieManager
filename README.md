## üöÄ Features

### üîê Authentication & Security
-JWT-based authentication (stored in secure HTTP-only cookies)
    Tokens are generated upon successful login and stored in cookies with httpOnly, secure (in production), and sameSite: 'Lax' to prevent XSS and CSRF attacks.

-CSRF protection using csurf middleware
    CSRF tokens are generated on the server and required for any state-changing operations. They are sent via a dedicated /csrf-token endpoint and validated on all protected routes.

-Rate limiting on login to prevent brute-force attacks
    Login endpoint is protected with express-rate-limit, allowing max 5 failed attempts per 15 minutes per IP. After exceeding the limit, the user receives a cooldown message with retry time.

-Session synchronization across tabs via BroadcastChannel
    When login/logout occurs in one tab, all other open tabs are immediately notified and either update or log out accordingly for a consistent user experience.

-Auto logout/login propagation across all open tabs
    Ensures session state is consistent across browser tabs. If a user logs out in one tab, all other tabs are also logged out immediately to avoid unauthorized actions.

-Password encryption
    User passwords are hashed using bcryptjs with a strong cost factor (saltRounds = 14) before storing in the database, ensuring security even if data is compromised.

-Input validation and sanitization
    User input during registration is validated using express-validator to enforce:

        -Minimum password length and complexity

        -Valid email format

        -Alphanumeric usernames

        -Input is also sanitized to mitigate injection and formatting attacks.

-CORS configuration
Only allows requests from your React frontend (http://localhost:3000), with credentials enabled. Headers such as Authorization and X-CSRF-Token are explicitly allowed.

-SQL injection protection
All MySQL queries use parameterized statements (via mysql2/promise) to prevent injection of malicious SQL code.

-Token-based route protection
A reusable authenticateToken middleware is used to protect all authenticated routes like /home, /me, and data-modifying endpoints.

-In-memory caching with expiration
Frequently accessed data (e.g., watchlists, friend lists) is cached server-side using node-cache, reducing DB load while still maintaining up-to-date information via cache invalidation on data changes.

### üë§ User Accounts
- Register and log in with strong validation
- Automatically fetch and cache user data upon login
- Edit user bio
- CSRF token fetched once after login and reused globally

### üé• Watchlist Management
- Add/remove movies from your watchlist
- Mark movies as watched and/or favorite
- Undo/redo recent changes with a history stack
- Smart caching using `localStorage`
- Restore unsaved changes after unexpected browser closure
- Watchlist stored per user

### üîç Discovery & Browsing
- View all users and their favorite genres
- Filter users by their genre
- View user profiles (based on privacy setting)
- Browse movies and add to your watchlist
- filter through movies 
- state management when browsing other accounts (E.G. possible to backtrack last visited accounts)

### ü§ù Friends & Social
- Send, cancel, accept, or reject friend requests
- Auto-accept mutual friend requests
- Control watchlist visibility (Private / Friends Only / Public)
- View / search through  friend list and request status on profiles
- Notification badge for incoming friend requests

### Recommendations
- Personalized movie recommendations based on each user's unique watch history and preferences.
- Powered by a custom machine learning engine using collaborative filtering and cosine similarity to detect similar users based on their watchlists.
- Falls back to genre-based recommendations if no similar users are found or the user has a very small watchlist.
- Uses parallel processing (multiprocessing.Pool) to efficiently collect recommendations from multiple similar users, ensuring fast performance even with many users.
- Dynamically updates after each change to the user's watchlist, ensuring recommendations are always relevant.
- Built with FastAPI for the ML backend and pandas + scikit-learn for data handling and similarity calculations.
- Fallback strategy includes:
    Most common genre detection from user's watched movies.
    Top-rated, most recent global movies if watchlist is completely empty.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mikahagenbeek/movie-manager.git
cd movie-manager
```

### 2. Start the App Using Docker

Make sure **Docker** and **Docker Compose** are installed on your machine. Then run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:

- üóÑÔ∏è Start the MySQL database  
- üõ†Ô∏è Start the backend Express.js server (Node)  
- üß© Start the React frontend  
- ü§ñ Start the FastAPI ML recommendation service  

### 3. Access the App

- Visit the frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)  
- Backend API: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)  
- Recommendation API: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)  

### 4. Optional: Seed the Database

To populate your database with movies and test users, you can either:

- Manually insert SQL via a DB tool (e.g., DBeaver, MySQL CLI), or  
- Extend the backend with a `/seed` endpoint (**recommended for development only**)

### 5. Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables to securely store sensitive configuration data.

Before running the app, create a `.env` file in the root of the project (or use the provided `.env.example` as a template) and set the following values:

```env
DB_USER=your_mysql_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=projectapi
SECRET_KEY=your_secure_secret_key
```

### 6. Development Tips

- üßæ Backend logs appear in the terminal from Docker Compose  
- ‚öõÔ∏è Frontend uses **React Context API** for Auth & Watchlist state  
- üîê You can test **login, registration, and recommendations** immediately  
- üõ°Ô∏è API rate-limiting and **CSRF protection** are enforced ‚Äî use proper headers when testing
